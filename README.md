# 🌫️ Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Environmental Insights

## 📌 Overview

Air pollution poses a significant threat to environmental and public health. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline to accurately predict **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using diverse environmental and meteorological datasets. Our models, including **XGBoost** and **LSTM**, are designed to provide actionable insights for public health, urban planning, and smart city initiatives.

Air quality monitoring using physical sensors is often limited by cost and geographic sparsity. Machine learning offers a scalable alternative, enabling real-time AQI predictions using structured, time-series data involving pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃), meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and location-specific attributes.
